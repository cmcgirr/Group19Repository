# Lab6
This is the repo for Lab 6 and we have added contents from Lab 7 as well for CMPINF0010

# Details
Its a simple program that myself (Conor McGirr), Ryan Durstewitz, and Drew Whiteside worked on. Besides the simple program, we have also added the Code of Conduct for software and a License document as well. For the Code of Coduct we chose the Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct. We think this type of conduct will us to work well between us and others that choose to access and make changes to the simple program. The license we chose is the GNU General Public License. This license allows anyone to access and modify the program in anyway they see fit. This allows everyone to work as one which is what we want. It also restricts the program or any data to be sold and once a user has access to the repo they can not restrict access to others that do not. 

# How the Program Works 
You enter your name and what school you go to and the output will print a fun message.
